BEopt idf to OSM workflow:
1. Generate an idf with BEopt
2. In idf editor or a text editor, remove any objects you don't want (schedules HVAC etc.). Leave in:
	Version
	Simulation Control
	Building
	Site Location
	Zone (remove dummy zones)
	BuildingSurface: Detailed
	FenestrationSurface: Detailed
	Optional Removes:
	(Material)
	(Material:NoMass)
	(WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem)
	(WindowMaterial:Shade)
	(Construction)
	If you remove materials and constructions, clear the construction fields in Objects:
		BuildingSurface: Detailed
		FenestrationSurface: Detailed
	Also clear the shading control field in FenestrationSurface: Detailed
3. Load the idf into sketchup. Remove shading surfaces and assign space names to the each thermal zone.
4. Load the idf into OS. Assign the weather file and rename the space names to something physical (living_1, crawlspace, etc.)
