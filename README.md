Calculates an Energy Rating Index via an OpenStudio/EnergyPlus-based workflow. Building information is provided through an [HPXML file](https://hpxml.nrel.gov/).

## Setup

Download the latest version of OpenStudio from https://www.openstudio.net/developers. At a minimum, install the "Command Line Interface".

## Running

1. Navigate to the `workflow` directory.
2. Run the ERI calculation on a provided sample HPXML file:  
```c:/openstudio-2.2.0/bin/openstudio.exe execute_ruby_script energy_rating_index.rb -x sample_files/valid.xml -e sample_files/denver.epw```  
Note that the Reference Home and Rated Home workflows/simulations will be executed in parallel on the local machine.
3. This should generate output like so. Results files (Reference/Rated HPXML files and output CSVs) will show up in the results/ dir.

## Disclaimers

*	The 301 ruleset and ERI calculation are very much both **works-in-progress**. 
* The format of the RESNET HPXML file is still in flux.
*	The workflow has only been tested with a few sample files, as provided in the `workflow/sample_files` directory.
*	Errors/warnings are not yet being handled gracefully.
*	No effort has been spent to optimize/speed up the process yet.
