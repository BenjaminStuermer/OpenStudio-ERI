EO = (C2 + C3 + C4 + A2 - B)/
(Q2 + Q3 + Q4 J2 + J3 + J4)

*EO is the energy cost adjustment to be used in the next customer billing cycle rounded on a consistent basis to the nearest $0.0001/kWh. For deliveries at voltages higher than secondary line voltages, appropriate factors should be applied to the energy cost adjustment to recognize the lower losses associated with these deliveries.
*C2, C3, and C4, are the charges by the wholesale suppliers as recorded in account 555 of the Uniform System of Accounts for the first three of the four months prior to the month in which EO will be used.
*Q2, Q3, and Q4, is the total electric energy delivered by the utility system during each of the months in which the expenses C2, C3, and C4, were incurred.
*B is the amount of electric energy cost included in the base rates of the utility's rate schedules.
*A2 is the end of the month energy cost adjustment account balance for the month of consumption J2. This would be the most recent month's balance available from actual accounting data.
*J2, J3, and J4, is the electric energy consumed under rates set by the Iowa Utilities Board in the months corresponding to C2, C3, and C4.
*B = *Test Year Power Cost/ Test Year kWh Sold
*B = $11,292,234/197,177,985 = $0.05727",http://www.linncountyrec.com/files/tariff/Sheet67.pdf,,,,,,

Definitions.

Bulk power cost (BPC) means those costs during the calculation period related to the purchase of wholesale power and the ownership of generation. 

Bulk power cost true-up (BPCT) means the difference between the bulk power cost actually incurred and the bulk power cost recovered through the power cost base and the bulk power cost adjustment may be deposited in or removed from a true-up account, as applicable. The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

Rate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

System loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. 

Power cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. 

Bulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation.

AUB buys all of its power from TVA. TVA dictates what type rate schedules AUB can have. TVA uses a Seasonal Rate Schedule that has different base rate levels depending on the season. For instance, there are four Summer Season months in the rate schedule (June - Sept), four Winter Season months (Dec - March) and four Transition Season months (April/May and Oct/Nov). Base per kilowatt hour rates are highest in the Summer months and lowest in the Transition months. That coincides with the cost to produce the power, i.e., demand for power and production costs to meet that demand are highest in the summer and lowest during mild spring and fall months.",http://www.aub.org/rate_power.php,,,,,,

building be so arranged as to permit each family to be served through a separate meter. In those cases

lieu of the foregoing, electric service rendered to a multi-family residential building through a single meter

rate.
If a separate meter is used to measure the consumption to remotely located buildings, such as garages,
